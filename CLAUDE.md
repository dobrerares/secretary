## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues at `dobrerares/secretary` via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default canonical vocabulary — `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root (created lazily by `/grill-with-docs`). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
